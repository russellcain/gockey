go fantasy hockey app - gopen to an improved project name.


## Learning Objectives:
  * Learn more Go!
    * Take a step up from one-off scripts and try to understand all that would go into a true RESTful Go application.
    * Dive into web-scraping in Go
    * Writing deeper test coverage
  * Brush up on Docker/Kubernetes
    * I want to look into deploying a bundled BE and FE project together
  * Dust off the TSX side of the brain
  * Refresh and tinker with hexagonal architecture
  * Try the CQRS approach on for size
    * Event Sourcing might feel like overkill, but I think a "Transactions" view would be neat in the final project
  * Really want to get into websockets, if there's time
